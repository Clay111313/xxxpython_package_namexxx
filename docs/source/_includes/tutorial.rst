Command-Line Tutorial
=====================

Before you begin using xxxpython_package_namexxx you will need to populate some custom settings within the xxxpython_package_namexxx settings file.

To setup the default settings file at ``~/.config/xxxpython_package_namexxx/xxxpython_package_namexxx.yaml`` run the command:

.. code-block:: bash 
    
    xxxpython_package_namexxx init

This should create and open the settings file; follow the instructions in the file to populate the missing settings values (usually given an ``XXX`` placeholder).
