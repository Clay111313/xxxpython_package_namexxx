# Initialisation 

Before using xxxpython_package_namexxx you need to use the `init` command to generate a user settings file. Running the following creates a [yaml](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) settings file in your home folder under `~/.config/xxxpython_package_namexxx/xxxpython_package_namexxx.yaml`:

```bash
xxxpython_package_namexxx init
```

The file is initially populated with xxxpython_package_namexxx's default settings which can be adjusted to your preference.

If at any point the user settings file becomes corrupted or you just want to start afresh, simply trash the `xxxpython_package_namexxx.yaml` file and rerun `xxxpython_package_namexxx init`.

<!-- Once created, open the settings file in any text editor and follow the in-file instructions to populate the missing settings values (usually given an ``XXX`` placeholder).  -->
